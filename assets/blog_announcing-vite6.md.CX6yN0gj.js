Vite adoption keeps growing, with npm downloads per week jumping from 7.5 million to 17 million since the release of Vite 5 a year ago. <a href="https://vitest.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vitest</a> is not only being favored more by users but is also starting to form an ecosystem of its own. For example, <a href="https://storybook.js.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Storybook</a> has new testing capabilities powered by Vitest.</p><p>New frameworks have also joined the Vite ecosystem, including <a href="https://tanstack.com/start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TanStack Start</a>, <a href="https://onestack.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">One</a>, <a href="https://emberjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ember</a>, and others.

Two months ago, we started a list of <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/companies-using-vite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">companies using Vite</a>. We&#39;re happy to see many developers sending us a PR to add their companies to the list.

You can also run <code>pnpm create vite-extra</code> to get access to templates from other frameworks and runtimes (Solid, Deno, SSR, and library starters). <code>create vite-extra</code> templates are also available when you run <code>create vite</code> under the <code>Others</code> option.</p><p>The Vite starter templates are intended to be used as a playground to test Vite with different frameworks. When building your next project, you should reach out to the starter recommended by each framework. <code>create vite</code> also provides a shortcut to setup proper starters by some frameworks, like <code>create-vue</code>, <code>Nuxt 3</code>, <code>SvelteKit</code>, <code>Remix</code>, <code>Analog</code>, and <code>Angular</code>.</p><h2 id="node-js-support" tabindex="-1">Node.js Support <a class="header-anchor" href="#node-js-support" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Node.js Support&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Vite 6 supports Node.js 18, 20, and 22+, similar to Vite 5. Node.js 21 support has been dropped. Vite drops Node.js support for older versions after their <a href="https://endoflife.date/nodejs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EOL</a>. The Node.js 18 EOL is at the end of April 2025, after which we may release a new major to bump the required Node.js version.</p><h2 id="experimental-environment-api" tabindex="-1">Experimental Environment API <a class="header-anchor" href="#experimental-environment-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Experimental Environment API&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Vite is getting more flexible with the new Environment API. These new APIs will allow framework authors to offer a dev experience closer to production and for the Ecosystem to share new building blocks. Nothing changes if you&#39;re building a SPA; when you use Vite with a single client environment, everything works as before. And even for custom SSR apps, Vite 6 is backward compatible. The primary target audience for Environment API is framework authors.</p><p>For end users who are curious, <a href="https://github.com/sapphi-red" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sapphi</a> wrote a great <a href="https://green.sapphi.red/blog/increasing-vites-potential-with-the-environment-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Introduction to Environment API</a> guide. It is a great place to start and understand why we&#39;re trying to make Vite even more flexible.</p><p>If you are a framework author or Vite plugin maintainer and would like to leverage the new APIs, you can learn more at the <a href="https://main.vite.dev/guide/api-environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Environment API Guides</a>.</p><p>We want to thank everyone involved in defining and implementing the new APIs. The story begins with Vite 2 adopting the unbundled SSR dev scheme pioneered by <a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rich Harris</a> and the <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SvelteKit</a> team. Vite&#39;s SSR transform then unlocked <a href="https://github.com/antfu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anthony Fu</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pi0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pooya Parsa</a> to create vite-node and improve <a href="https://antfu.me/posts/dev-ssr-on-nuxt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nuxt&#39;s Dev SSR story</a>. Anthony went to use vite-node to power <a href="https://vitest.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vitest</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/sheremet-va" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vladimir Sheremet</a> kept improving it as part of his work maintaining Vitest. At the beginning of 2023, Vladimir started working to upstream vite-node to Vite Core, and we released it as Runtime API in Vite 5.1 a year later. Feedback from ecosystem partners (special shout-out to the Cloudflare team) pushed us to do a more ambitious rework of Vite&#39;s environments. You can learn more about the story at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WImor3HDyqU?si=EZ-rFJn4pDW3tUvp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Patak&#39;s ViteConf 24 talk</a>.</p><p>Everyone on the Vite team participated in defining the new API, which was co-designed with feedback from many projects in the Ecosystem. Thanks to everyone involved! We encourage you to get involved if you&#39;re building a framework, plugin, or tool on top of Vite. The new APIs are experimental. We will work with the Ecosystem to review how the new APIs will be used and stabilize them for the next major.
